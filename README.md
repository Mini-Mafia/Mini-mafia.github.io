Welcome to the MINI MAFIA!
This is an organization devoted to making unblocked websites.
The organization is making their first actual game website (as a group), so please support!
Thank you if you use it! <br>
Credit to: ubg98 and jsDelivr. Go support them too!
I'm just going to put a bunch of links to signify which link goes to which game until we add a drop-down menu.
Bitlife: mini-mafia.github.io/games/bitlife.html
A Small World Cup: mini-mafia.github.io/games/asmallworldcup.html
I'll add much more when i get the time (or we get a drop-down menu!)
